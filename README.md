## 1. Introduction

The **Scenic Seat Recommender** addresses a common traveler frustration: missing beautiful sunrises or sunsets due to sitting on the wrong side of the aircraft. The application calculates optimal window seat positions (left or right) based on flight routes, departure times, and real-time sun positioning.

### Core Goal
Provide travelers with data-driven seat recommendations to maximize their chances of witnessing scenic aerial views during their journey.

### Key Innovation
Unlike static seat maps or airline recommendations, our system performs real-time calculations considering:
- Great-circle flight paths
- Solar azimuth and altitude calculations
- Flight timing and duration
- Geographic positioning

## 2. Original Prompt & Objectives

### Initial Problem Statement
*"Build a web application using LLM-powered IDE that helps air travelers choose the best seat for enjoying scenic views during their flight. Many travelers want to see beautiful sunrises or sunsets from their airplane window, but they often end up on the wrong side of the aircraft and miss these moments entirely."*

### My Initial Prompt to Cursor IDE
```
I want to build a project called Scenic Seat Recommender using Next.js for the 
frontend and Express.js for the backend. The idea is that a traveler can enter 
their departure airport, arrival airport, and flight time, and the app will 
recommend whether to sit on the left or right side of the plane to enjoy the 
best views like sunrise or sunset.

I'm thinking of different ways to approach this and would like your suggestions. 
For example, should I use an airport dataset like OpenFlights stored locally, 
or rely on an external API for airport coordinates? For the flight path, would 
it be better to use a library like Turf.js or Geolib to compute the great-circle 
route, or just write a custom function? For the sun position, should I go with 
something simple like SunCalc or consider APIs like NOAA for more accuracy? 
And for visualization, should I stick with Leaflet.js for a free and easy map, 
use Mapbox for nicer visuals, or even Google Maps?

Can you lay out the pros and cons of these options and suggest which combination 
would make the most sense for a first working version that's both simple and effective?
```

### Project Validation with ChatGPT

**Context**: Before diving into implementation, I consulted ChatGPT to validate the project concept and identify potential challenges.

**ChatGPT Consultation Prompt**:
```
I'm building a "Scenic Seat Recommender" that tells airplane passengers whether 
to sit on the left or right side for best sunrise/sunset views. The app takes 
departure airport, arrival airport, and flight time, then calculates:

1. Great-circle flight path between airports
2. Sun position at flight time and location
3. Relative angles to determine optimal viewing side

Questions:
- Is this concept technically feasible?
- What are the main challenges I should anticipate?
- How accurate can recommendations be with great-circle assumptions?
- What edge cases should I consider (polar routes, night flights, etc.)?
```

**Key Insights from ChatGPT**:
- ‚úÖ Concept is mathematically sound
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Great-circle routes vs actual flight paths (air traffic control)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Aircraft orientation and window angles vary
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Weather conditions significantly impact visibility
- üí° Confidence scoring important for user trust

### Derived Requirements

#### Functional Requirements
1. **Airport Input**: Accept departure and arrival airports via IATA codes or city names
2. **Time Input**: Flight date and time for accurate sun position calculations
3. **Seat Recommendation**: Output left/right window seat suggestion with reasoning
4. **Route Visualization**: Interactive map displaying flight path and sun overlay
5. **Autocomplete**: Intelligent airport search functionality

#### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: Sub-3-second response times for recommendations
2. **Accuracy**: Precise great-circle route calculations
3. **Usability**: Intuitive UI requiring no additional explanations
4. **Scalability**: Support for global airport database (7000+ airports)
5. **Reliability**: Offline-capable with local datasets

## 3. Design Process & UI Development

### 3.1 Design Conceptualization with v0 by Vercel

**Initial Design Challenge**: Creating an intuitive interface for flight seat recommendations without overwhelming users with technical complexity.

**My Design Process**:

1. **Problem Analysis**: Users need to input minimal information (departure, arrival, time) and receive clear, actionable recommendations
2. **Design Research**: Analyzed travel booking sites and recommendation platforms for UX patterns
3. **Tool Selection**: Chose v0 by Vercel for rapid UI prototyping and design iteration

**v0 Design Prompt**:
```
Description: Build a web application using LLM-powered IDE that helps air travelers choose the best seat for enjoying scenic views during their flight. E.g., Many travelers want to see beautiful sunrises or sunsets from their airplane window, but they often end up on the wrong side of the aircraft and miss these moments entirely. Here are the outputs : ‚óè Seat Recommendation ‚óè Interactive Visualization (Bonus) ‚óã E.g., display a map with the flight path and real-time sun position overlay. Definition of Done: ‚óè Design a good UX and decide on the appropriate input to take from the user ‚óè Have a UI that you can demonstrate ‚óã UI should be clear for the User without any additional explanations ‚óè Don‚Äôt bother about collecting flight data. You can assume that flights between two cities always follow the same air path. Note: Remember, you can go beyond the basics with this problem. Demonstrate your ability to create a user-friendly app and think creatively.

## 6. Decision Making & Trade-offs

### 6.1 Airport Data: Local Dataset Victory

**Decision**: Chose local OpenFlights dataset over external APIs

**Reasoning Process with Cursor**:
1. **Initial Recommendation**: Cursor suggested AviationStack API for real-time data
2. **My Analysis**: Calculated 1000 requests/month = ~33 users/day limit
3. **Cost Projection**: $49/month for 10,000 requests would limit scalability
4. **Performance Consideration**: Local dataset = 0ms lookup vs 200-500ms API calls
5. **Reliability Factor**: No network dependency for core functionality

**Key Decision Moment**:
```
My Prompt: "I want you to remove the aviation API and use dataset as you 
suggested earlier"

Cursor Response: [Provided implementation with local CSV parsing]

My Follow-up: "I have airport.dat file, can you fix that"
```

**Trade-off Analysis**:
- ‚úÖ **Gained**: Zero operational costs, sub-100ms responses, offline capability
- ‚ùå **Lost**: Real-time airport updates, detailed airport information
- üéØ **Impact**: Enabled unlimited user testing and deployment flexibility

### 6.2 Flight Path: Custom Implementation Win

**Decision**: Replaced Turf.js with custom Haversine implementation

**Problem Encountered**:
```
Error [ERR_REQUIRE_ESM]: require() of ES Module 
C:\Users\Hp\Downloads\Trilogy Project\backend\node_modules\concaveman\index.js 
from C:\Users\Hp\Downloads\Trilogy Project\backend\node_modules\@turf\convex\dist\js\index.js 
not supported.
```

**My Decision Process**:
1. **Cursor's Initial Suggestion**: Use @turf/great-circle for precision
2. **Error Analysis**: ESM compatibility issues with Node.js require()
3. **Alternative Evaluation**: Custom implementation vs fixing ESM issues
4. **Code Review**: Examined Turf.js source - overkill for our use case
5. **Implementation Decision**: 50-line custom function vs 500KB library

**Final Implementation**:
```javascript
function calculateFlightPath(start, end) {
  const R = 6371e3; // metres
  const œÜ1 = toRadians(start.lat);
  const œÜ2 = toRadians(end.lat);
  const ŒîœÜ = toRadians(end.lat - start.lat);
  const ŒîŒª = toRadians(end.lon - start.lon);

  const a = Math.sin(ŒîœÜ / 2) * Math.sin(ŒîœÜ / 2) +
            Math.cos(œÜ1) * Math.cos(œÜ2) *
            Math.sin(ŒîŒª / 2) * Math.sin(ŒîŒª / 2);
  const c = 2 * Math.atan2(Math.sqrt(a), Math.sqrt(1 - a));
  return R * c; // distance in metres
}
```

### 6.3 Sun Position: SunCalc Sufficiency

**Decision**: Chose SunCalc over NOAA API

**Analysis**:
- SunCalc accuracy: ¬±0.1¬∞ (sufficient for seat recommendations)
- NOAA accuracy: ¬±0.01¬∞ (overkill for our use case)
- Response time: Instant vs 200-500ms
- Dependency: Local library vs external API

### 7.3 Enhanced Algorithm Implementation

**Advanced Recommendation Logic** (User-Provided Enhancement):
```javascript
function determineBestSeat(flightPath, sunPosition) {
  if (!sunPosition.isDaytime) {
    return {
      seat: 'Either',
      reason: 'Night flight - no scenic advantage for either side',
      confidence: 'low'
    };
  }

  // Calculate relative angles between flight direction and sun position
  const flightBearing = flightPath.bearing;
  const sunAzimuth = sunPosition.azimuth;
  
  // Determine which side faces the sun more directly
  const leftBearing = (flightBearing + 90) % 360;
  const rightBearing = (flightBearing - 90 + 360) % 360;
  
  const leftAngle = Math.abs(leftBearing - sunAzimuth);
  const rightAngle = Math.abs(rightBearing - sunAzimuth);
  
  // Normalize angles to 0-180 range
  const normalizedLeftAngle = leftAngle > 180 ? 360 - leftAngle : leftAngle;
  const normalizedRightAngle = rightAngle > 180 ? 360 - rightAngle : rightAngle;
  
  // Determine optimal side and generate reasoning
  const isLeftBetter = normalizedLeftAngle < normalizedRightAngle;
  const angleDifference = Math.abs(normalizedLeftAngle - normalizedRightAngle);
  
  // Calculate confidence based on angle difference and sun altitude
  let confidence = 'medium';
  if (angleDifference > 45 && sunPosition.altitude > 15) {
    confidence = 'high';
  } else if (angleDifference < 15 || sunPosition.altitude < 5) {
    confidence = 'low';
  }
  
  return {
    seat: isLeftBetter ? 'Left Window' : 'Right Window',
    reason: generateContextualReason(sunPosition.altitude, isLeftBetter),
    confidence
  };
}
```

## 8. Challenges & Resolutions

| Challenge | Description | Root Cause | Resolution | Decision Process |
|-----------|-------------|------------|------------|------------------|
| **ESM Module Error** | `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM` with Turf.js | Library using ES modules vs CommonJS | Custom Haversine implementation | Reviewed Turf.js source, deemed overkill, implemented 50-line alternative |
| **Airport Search Failing** | Autocomplete only worked with exact IATA codes | Search logic only matched IATA field | Enhanced search to include city/country fields | Added fuzzy matching across multiple fields |
| **Windows PowerShell Error** | `${NEXT_PUBLIC_PORT:-3000}` syntax error | Shell variable expansion not supported | Hardcoded port in package.json | Simplified to avoid cross-platform issues |
| **CSV Parse Module Error** | `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED` | Incorrect import path for csv-parse | Switched to `.dat` file with custom parser | Manual parsing more reliable than library dependency |
| **Map SSR Error** | `window is not defined` | Leaflet requires browser environment | Dynamic import with `ssr: false` | Isolated client-side rendering for map component |
| **CORS Configuration** | API calls blocked in production | Missing production frontend URL | Environment-based CORS setup | Flexible CORS for dev/prod environments |

### 8.1 The Airport Search Challenge

**Problem**: Users typing "Delhi" received no suggestions, only IATA codes worked.

**My Investigation Process**:
1. **Initial Cursor Implementation**: Basic IATA code matching
2. **User Experience Testing**: Tried typing city names - no results
3. **Code Review**: Identified limitation in search logic
4. **Enhancement Request**: Asked Cursor to expand search fields

**Before (Limited)**:
```javascript
let airport = airports.find(a => a.iata === trimmedQuery);
```

**After (Enhanced)**:
```javascript
const filtered = airports.filter(a =>
  (a.iata && a.iata.toLowerCase().startsWith(q)) ||
  (a.name && a.name.toLowerCase().includes(q)) ||
  (a.city && a.city.toLowerCase().includes(q)) ||
  (a.country && a.country.toLowerCase().includes(q))
);
```

**Impact**: User could now type "Delhi" and see "DEL ‚Äî Indira Gandhi International"

<img width="1215" height="911" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b88e979-ce45-49eb-a590-19d442aa0690" />

## 9. LLM Collaboration & Code Review Process

### 9.1 Prompt Engineering Strategy

**Effective Prompting Patterns**:

1. **Context-Rich Requests**:
```
‚ùå Poor: "Fix the autocomplete"
‚úÖ Good: "The autocomplete functionality is still not working. I have to enter 
the airport code in order to search for results. For example, when I type 
'delhi', it should suggest Delhi airport with the format 'DEL ‚Äî Indira Gandhi 
International (India)'. Currently, only exact IATA codes work."
```

2. **Specific Technical Requirements**:
```
‚úÖ "Make sure the form appears below the find my perfect seat section and 
make sure the result appears there only and map at below of the page and 
a button near the result to jump to the map"
```

### 9.2 Code Review Process

**My Systematic Review Approach**:

1. **Functionality Verification**:
   - Test each suggested change in isolation
   - Verify edge cases and error handling
   - Check mobile responsiveness

2. **Performance Analysis**:
   - Bundle size impact assessment
   - Runtime performance implications
   - Memory usage considerations

3. **Maintainability Evaluation**:
   - Code complexity assessment
   - Documentation adequacy
   - Future extensibility

**Example Review Cycle**:

**Cursor Suggestion**: Use Turf.js for flight path calculation
```javascript
const turf = require('@turf/turf');
const from = turf.point([startLon, startLat]);
const to = turf.point([endLon, endLat]);
const route = turf.greatCircle(from, to);
```

**My Review Process**:
1. ‚úÖ **Accuracy**: Mathematically correct
2. ‚ùå **Bundle Size**: 500KB+ overhead
3. ‚ùå **Complexity**: ESM compatibility issues
4. ‚ùå **Necessity**: Overkill for basic distance calculation

**My Counter-Proposal**: "Let's implement a custom Haversine function instead"

**Result**: 50-line implementation vs 500KB library dependency

### 9.3 When I Disagreed with Cursor

**Scenario 1: External API Preference**
- **Cursor's Suggestion**: Use AviationStack API for real-time data
- **My Analysis**: Rate limits would severely constrain usage
- **Decision**: Overrode recommendation, chose local dataset
- **Outcome**: Unlimited usage capability, faster responses

**Scenario 2: Complex UI Framework**
- **Cursor's Initial Approach**: Separate results page
- **My UX Review**: Too many navigation steps
- **Modification**: Single-page experience with progressive disclosure
- **Result**: Better user flow, reduced bounce rate
